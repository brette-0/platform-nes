/**
 * @file platform-nes.h
 * @brief Umbrella header for the platform-nes library.
 *
 * Pulls in every public subsystem header (types, technology, reset,
 * input, video, audio, interrupts) and establishes the compile-time
 * configuration required by the rest of the library:
 *
 * - Exactly one of ::LANDSCAPE or ::PORTRAIT must be defined to select
 *   nametable mirroring. Defining both, or neither, is a hard error.
 * - ::TARGET_NES selects the 6502/NES backend; when absent the SDL3
 *   desktop backend is used instead.
 *
 * Include this file — not the individual subsystem headers — from
 * application code.
