 * CHR-ROM windows (::VRC1::chr0Control, ::VRC1::chr1Control, with the shared

 * must survive a bankswitch into the mapper's always-mapped $E000-$FFFF
 * window.
 *
 * A class rather than a namespace, matching ::mmc3: all members static, no
 * constructor, since there is one physical chip and no object to build. See

         * @brief Resolves a section_t (rom_address+size) to whatever register(s)
         *        writes VRC1 needs, then runs @p fn.
         *
         * WINDOW comes from the low 16 bits of rom_address -- the CPU-visible
         * VMA, exactly what an absolute JSR truncates to. BANK is separate: with
         * no high bits set, bank == window index, the one-bank-per-window
         * default; where bank_layout hand-encodes a real bank number in the high
         * bits, that wins. So un-encoded tags keep working while explicit-bank
         * tags get a distinct bank.
         *
         * WINDOW COUNT is `size` ceil-divided by kWindowSize. Unlike
         * rom_address, size is genuinely link-computed for an oversized domain,
         * so this division costs real runtime bytes -- an accepted cost of
         * dynamic sizing, not a missed optimization.
         *
         * [[gnu::noinline]] for the same load-bearing reason as CallInWindow's,
         * and this is the entry point Call<Fn>/CallBlock<Fn> invoke, so it
         * matters most.
