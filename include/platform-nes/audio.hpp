/**
 * @file audio.hpp
 * @brief Music and sound-effect playback API.
 *
 * Provides a uniform interface over two very different audio backends:
 *
 * - **NES**: drives the FamiStudio sound engine directly; tracks and
 *   SFX are raw byte streams in ROM.
 * - **SDL3**: decodes PCM from disk and mixes it into a shared output
 *   buffer.
 *
 * Application code should use the ::TRACKS and ::SFX macros to register
 * assets at file scope, then call the play/update helpers at runtime.

/*
 * THE NES BACKEND IS A PROJECT CHOICE, NOT A LIB ONE: platform-nes ships no
 * audio driver of its own. These are plain prototypes -- a real definition
 * arrives when the project's chosen backend source file is compiled into the
 * build (src/nes/audio/famistudio.cpp on NES, this platform's own audio.cpp
 * elsewhere), the ordinary way any declared-but-not-yet-defined function
 * works. Nothing here needs to know which one, or whether it exists yet.
 *
 * FamiStudio's backend is PLACED BY THE CONSUMING PROJECT, into the same
 * PRG-ROM bank as the audio engine it drives -- that adjacency is what lets
 * it reach the engine with plain calls and contain no bank switching at all.
 * The knob is PLATFORM_NES_AUDIO_SECTION. Nothing that merely CALLS this API
 * needs to know that either -- see famistudio.cpp's own header comment.
