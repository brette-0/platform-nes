/**
 * @file vrc1.cpp
 * @brief Emu-side (off-NES) VRC1 register storage and tile-address
 *        translation. Counterpart to src/nes/mappers/vrc1.cpp, which owns
 *        the real hardware port writes and is only built for the NES
 *        target -- see vrc1.hpp's own file comment.
 *
 * VRC1::window1Control/window2Control/window3Control/chrHighBits/chr0Control/
 * chr1Control are declared unconditionally in vrc1.hpp, so they need a
 * definition on every target, not just NES, the same reasoning as MMC3's
 * emu-side mmc3.cpp: ::VRC1::SwitchBank/::VRC1::SwitchCHRBank already branch
 * their hardware-poke path on TARGET_NES internally.
 *
 * Real NES hardware performs CHR bank switching in silicon; off-NES, the emu
 * PPU (src/emu/ppu.cpp) instead renders straight from one flat, non-bank-
 * switched CHR-ROM image (::patternTable), so this file is the software
 * stand-in for what VRC1 would otherwise be doing on the PPU's own address
 * bus: it tracks which physical 4 KiB CHR bank is currently switched into
 * each of VRC1's two pattern-table windows, and answers "what's the real
 * offset for this PPU-space tile address" via ::VRC1::GetTileLMA. This file
 * also supplies the strong (non-weak) definition of ::ppu::ResolveTile the
 * emu PPU calls unconditionally for every tile fetch -- see that function's
 * own doc comment (video.hpp) for why this always wins over the emu PPU's
 * own weak default with no runtime dispatch.
