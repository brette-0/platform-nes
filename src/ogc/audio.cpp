/**
 * @file audio.cpp
 * @brief Music playback for the native GameCube + Wii backend (libogc/ASND).
 *
 * Real Nintendo DSP-ADPCM decode is NOT reachable from this toolchain: ASND
 * and AESND (libogc's two audio APIs) only expose raw-PCM voice formats, and
 * the ADPCM decode microcode Nintendo's own SDK used was never released for
 * homebrew -- devkitPro's dsp.h is just a raw DSP-task loader with no ADPCM
 * task to hand it. So this follows the same shape as the Wii U backend
 * (src/wiiu/audio.cpp): the desktop pc_audio.wav is transcoded to a small
 * Vorbis OGG at build time and #embedded into the binary (see the gc/wii
 * branch of CMakeLists.txt), decoded here with stb_vorbis.
 *
 * Unlike Wii U (which streams via an SDL2 callback on its own audio thread),
 * libogc has no SDL audio device, so playback is polled from audio::Update(),
 * which the engine already calls once per video frame. ASND supports exactly
 * two buffers per voice -- one playing, one queued -- so Update() checks
 * ASND_TestVoiceBufferReady() and decodes the next chunk into whichever of
 * the two ping-ponged buffers isn't currently playing. Buffers are sized to
 * ~0.37s of audio, far more than one frame needs, so a missed Update() call
 * or two (e.g. a GC build's occasional per-frame hitch) doesn't starve
 * playback. GC/Wii RAM (24MB/64MB) also can't hold the whole 47MB source
 * decoded to raw PCM the way Wii U's approach effectively can, which is the
 * other reason this streams instead of decoding once at Init like Wii U does.
 *
 * Full pre-rendered streaming is also the only workflow the DSP-ADPCM
 * question upstream of this landed on: there's no per-note ADPCM sampler
 * here, just a compressed audio stream played back start-to-loop-point.
