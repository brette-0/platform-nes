/**
 * @file audio.cpp
 * @brief Audio backend stub for the Nintendo 3DS.
 *
 * The shared engine expects every backend to define the audio entry points
 * (see audio.hpp) plus the ::pcm_buffer / ::pcm_buffer_size globals the non-NES
 * build references. A full implementation would mix the demo's PCM tracks
 * through the 3DS's ndsp; for the initial homebrew bring-up these are inert so
 * the library links and the demo runs silent. The signatures match the SDL and
 * libogc backends exactly, so swapping in a real ndsp mixer later touches only
 * this file.
