#include <platform-nes/audio.hpp>
#include <platform-nes/technology.hpp>   // CREATE_SEGMENT_KEYWORD

/**
 * @brief Placement keyword for this module's own code -- the section is the
 *        CONSUMING PROJECT'S choice, supplied as PLATFORM_NES_AUDIO_SECTION.
 *
 * THE WHOLE POINT: the audio backend must land in the SAME PRG-ROM bank as
 * the engine it drives. A project already controls where the engine goes
 * (its FamiStudio config's FAMISTUDIO_CA65_CODE_SEGMENT, and the ca65 wrappers
 * around any exported data); this is the matching knob for this module, so the
 * two can be put side by side.
 *
 * Once they are neighbours, THIS MODULE CONTAINS NO BANK-SWITCHING AT ALL.
 * A caller long-calls audio::Update(); inside it, famistudio_update() is an
 * ordinary call, because the engine is already mapped -- the caller's own
 * switch brought both in together. That is why nothing here includes a
 * mapper header, names a bank, or knows which mapper the board even has.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT NAMED AFTER FAMISTUDIO. A replacement engine written in
 * C, C++, Rust or hand-written assembly binds to the same arrangement by
 * placing itself in the same section, with no change to audio.hpp -- its
 * functions are plain prototypes, satisfied by whichever backend source
 * file the project compiles in.
 *
 * COMPULSORY, not defaulted. There is no "unbanked" fallback value: a
 * default would silently place this module wherever the library guessed,
 * which is exactly the wrong-bank-with-no-diagnostic failure the rest of
 * this design works to make impossible. A project that banks nothing still
 * names the section its ordinary code lands in.

 * FamiStudio is assembled by a genuine standalone ca65 binary
 * (CMakeLists.txt), and its own config places it into whichever PRG-ROM bank
 * the project chose. EVERY FUNCTION IN THIS FILE IS TAGGED
 * ::AUDIO_BANK so it lands in that same bank -- which is the only reason the
 * calls below can be plain calls.
 *
 * THIS FILE CONTAINS NO BANK SWITCHING, deliberately, and includes no mapper
 * header. The caller long-calls audio::Update(); by the time control arrives
 * here the engine is already mapped, because it came in with this module. If
 * the engine reads data from a further bank (an exported song, say), mapping
 * that is likewise the caller's business, decided where the layout is decided
 * -- not hardcoded in the backend adapter.
 *
 * That keeps this file portable in the way that matters: swapping FamiStudio
 * for a different engine, or this board for one with no banking at all, is a
 * change to placement and to the caller, never to the code here.
