// Scratch bytes for the shift-register read below. Named with C linkage so the
// inline asm can address them directly by symbol instead of through a runtime
// pointer (ROR has no (zp),Y addressing mode, so the running accumulator can't
// live at *port1/*port2 directly -- those are only reachable indirectly).
// `used` is load-bearing: the asm block below has an empty operand list, so
// as far as LLVM's IR is concerned nothing ever references these globals --
// the only "use" is the literal symbol name inside opaque asm text, which
// ordinary use-analysis can't see. Without `used`, LTO's dead-global
// elimination strips both of these before they even make it into
// libplatform-nes.a, and the final link fails with "undefined symbol"
// (verified: they're absent from the .a's symbol table without this
// attribute). Same fix this codebase already relies on for the NMI/IRQ vector
// functions in interrupts.hpp, which are likewise only reachable by a path
// (the raw hardware vector table) invisible to the compiler.

// Classic NESdev shift-register read: each of the 8 clocks moves the new bit
// into the top of the byte and everything else down one, so after exactly 8
// rotations the scratch byte is fully replaced by the 8 new bits -- no need to
// zero it first, and no separate shift/mask/OR-into-memory per bit. This
// replaces a fully-unrolled loop that did a load+shift+and+load+or+store
// (through *port1/*port2 each iteration) with a tight 8-cycle loop body that
// does the accumulation with a single RMW rotate per controller.
