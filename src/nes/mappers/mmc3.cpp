/**
 * @brief Cold-boot init: silence the scanline IRQ unit, point R6/R7 at the
 *        flat image's first two banks, enable PRG-RAM, then fall through
 *        to crt0's _start.
 *
 * Runs BEFORE .bss is zeroed: raw tech::poke() only, no Register shadow
 * objects, and no calls to non-::FIXED functions -- the windows aren't
 * established yet, so anything unpinned could resolve into whatever bank
 * powered up mapped. Real hardware powers up with R0-R7, mirroring, PRG-RAM
 * and the IRQ unit all undefined, so nothing here can be skipped as probably
 * already correct.
 *
 * THE $E000 WRITE IS SAFETY-CRITICAL, not tidiness. If the IRQ-enable latch
 * powers up (or survives a soft reset) already set, the scanline counter can
 * fire long before any application code arms it -- A12 clocks on ordinary
 * $2006 writes, and early boot is full of those. The CPU's interrupt-disable
 * flag holds the request pending rather than servicing it, so it surfaces
 * later, the moment interrupts are enabled: a crash that looks intermittent
 * because it tracks residual state rather than anything in the source.
 * Writing $E000 first, unconditionally, disables generation and acknowledges
 * whatever was pending. $C000/$C001 need no pre-seed, since
 * ::ScheduleScanlineIRQ writes both before re-enabling via $E001.
 *
 * R0-R5 and $A000 are deliberately NOT touched: CHR banks and mirroring are
 * per-game choices, not mapper bootstrap facts, and getting them wrong is
 * cosmetic rather than fatal. A project sets them in its own RESET body.
 *
 * With no MMC3_BANKED() domain in use this reconstructs one flat $8000-$FFFF
 * image from the ROM's top four banks, at any size from 32 KiB to MMC3's
 * 512 KiB maximum: R6/R7 take the image's first two banks
 * (__mmc3_boot_bank_window1/2), and the remaining two appear at
 * $C000-$FFFF automatically in PRG mode 0. That is size-independent only
 * because the linker script anchors the image to the top of the ROM file.
