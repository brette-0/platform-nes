; FamiStudio sound engine configuration -- a REAL, project-owned config
; file, not CMake-generated. Edit this directly for this project's own
; needs (a different game/song/SFX set would edit its own copy of this
; file, not a CMake cache variable).
;
; CMakeLists.txt reads most values back out of this file (regex-extracted)
; so audio.cpp's own #if FAMISTUDIO_CFG_* checks and the BANKED_EXTERN
; segment tag it uses to reach famistudio_update() etc. stay honest against
; whatever's actually configured here -- it never generates or owns this
; file's content. See BANKED_CALL_THEORY.txt's "RESOLVED: famistudio_config.s
; moves to the demo root as a real, directly-edited file" for the reasoning.
; NTSC/PAL support are the one exception: CMake's REGION variable (set from
; TARGET_PLATFORM, see CMakeLists.txt) is fed in below via -D, and this file
; derives FAMISTUDIO_CFG_NTSC_SUPPORT/PAL_SUPPORT from it rather than
; carrying its own separate literal -- CMakeLists.txt computes the identical
; values from that same REGION for its own compile definitions, so the two
; can't drift apart.

; _pprg__rom__audio_fx decodes to the ELF section ".prg_rom_audio", marked
; executable. ld.lld's XO65 reader treats '_' in a ca65 segment name as an
; ESCAPE character, not a literal -- which is why a plain "FAMISTUDIO_CODE"
; is rejected outright ("unknown underscore escape"). The escapes, confirmed
; empirically against ld.lld itself: __ -> '_', _p -> '.', _d -> '$',
; _h -> '-', _xNN -> byte NN, _tp/_tn -> section type PROGBITS/NOBITS,
; _fw/_fx -> flags writable/executable. Note the DOUBLED underscores: every
; literal '_' in ".prg_rom_002" has to be escaped as well, which is why this
; reads _pprg__rom__audio_fx and not _pprg_rom_audio_fx (that spelling is
; rejected -- '_r' is not an escape).
;
; Naming the section after the BANK rather than after FamiStudio is
; deliberate: demo/link.ld's own .prg_rom_002 wildcard picks this up with no
; engine-specific rule, and a replacement audio engine written in C, C++ or
; Rust targets the identical section with its own toolchain's mechanism
; (__attribute__((section(".prg_rom_audio"))) / #[link_section]). Nothing about
; the layout knows which engine is in the bank.
