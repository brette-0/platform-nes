// Dynamic tile layer (prototype scaffolding)
//
// A second RLE plane authored as a separate Tiled layer, compressed with the
// same {length, data} scheme and covering the same WxH metatile grid as the
// static plane. It holds the interactive / animated tiles -- coins, blocks,
// ... -- that the game mutates at runtime. It has no terminator of its own: it
// spans the same number of cells as the static plane, whose 0x00 terminator
// already bounds the walk.
//
// Unlike the static plane (run-data lives in ROM and is fetched in place), the
// dynamic plane's run DATA is copied once into a fixed RAM array so individual
// runs can be blanked when their tile is consumed. The run LENGTHS stay in ROM
// (they never change). So a DynamicCursor streams lengths from ROM but peeks
// data from RAM.
//
// STATUS: no level ships a dynamic layer yet, so the ROM sources are null and
// three integration points are deliberately stubbed / left uncalled:
//   (a) LoadDynamicLayer  -- ROM->RAM copy, called from LoadLevel once data exists
//   (b) render compositing -- dynamic-over-static inside the column builders
//   (c) the actor double-probe -- needs real actor collision response
// The data structures, cursor, collision query and removal jump table are real.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
